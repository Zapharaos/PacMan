# Pec men

This project is about re-developing the famous « PAC-MAN » game made by Namco and released in 1980.
Our version was made using C++ and the SDL library.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libsdl2-dev
```

## Usage

Set up the build environment
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
```

Build using cmake
```sh
cmake ..
make
```

Run the game
```sh
./PacMan
```

Enjoy !
